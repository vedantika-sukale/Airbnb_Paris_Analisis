# 🏠 Airbnb Paris Analysis
Analysis of Airbnb Trends in Paris
This project analyzes how the Airbnb market in Paris has changed over time. It focuses on three main factors: **New Government Regulations**, **Neighborhood Trends**, and **Pricing Strategies**. The goal is to understand how these factors affect both the number of hosts (supply) and the number of travelers (demand).

The project involves **Cleaning Raw Data**, **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and using visualizations to create practical business advice.
