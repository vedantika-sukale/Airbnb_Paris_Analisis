# 🏠 Airbnb Paris Analysis
Analysis of Airbnb Trends in Paris
This project analyzes how the Airbnb market in Paris has changed over time. It focuses on three main factors: **New Government Regulations**, **Neighborhood Trends**, and **Pricing Strategies**. The goal is to understand how these factors affect both the number of hosts (supply) and the number of travelers (demand).

The project involves **Cleaning Raw Data**, **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and using visualizations to create practical business advice.


---

## 📌 Objectives

- **Analyze Supply Growth:** Track how the number of listings changed between 2008 and 2021.

- **Evaluate Regulations:** Measure the impact of the 2017 rental laws on new hosts joining the market.

- **Study Pricing:** Compare prices across different neighborhoods to understand affordability.

- **Capacity vs. Price:** examine the link between a property’s size (guest capacity) and its nightly rate.

- **Business Strategy:** Provide data-driven recommendations for stakeholders.

  ---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Early Boom (2008–2016):** The market grew very fast with many new hosts and listings appearing.

- **Impact of 2017 Rules:** After new regulations passed, the number of new hosts entering the market slowed down significantly.

- **Stable Demand:** Even though fewer new hosts joined, the demand from customers remained strong.

- **Price Changes:** Before 2017, competition kept prices low. After the regulations limited the supply, average prices started to rise.

- **Location Analysis:** Central Paris remains the most expensive area, while outer districts appeal to budget travelers.
